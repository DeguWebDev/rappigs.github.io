			<h2 id="about">What are Rappigs?</h2>
			<p>Rappigs (also known as "buusagi" or ブウサギ), are an animal species in the <em>Tales Of</em> video game universe.</p>
			<p>They are "rabbit-pigs", and are rabbits who look like pigs. They are spotted pink, have long ears, and a nub tail.</p>
			<p>Rappigs are a farm animal, but can also be kept as pets.</p>
			<p><em>Not to be mistaken with piggits! Piggits are pigs with rabbit ears and a curly tail, and they are apparently toxic to eat.</em></p>

			<hr />
			<h2 id="games">Tales of the Abyss</h2>
			<p>The first appearance of rappigs were in <em>Tales of the Abyss</em> where they also received the most focus of any Tales game. Emperor Peony has a group of five (six at the end of the game) pet rappigs named after his friends: Aslan, Gelda, Jade, Nephry, and Saphir.</p>

			<p>Rappigs were also the focus of a sidequest in <em>Tales of Xillia</em>&#8230; though it isn&#8217;t as friendly for the rappig!</p>
